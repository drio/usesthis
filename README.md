A spin-off of the [usesthis](http://usesthis.com/) site.

The Setup is a website of nerdy interviews, asking people what they use to get
the job done. It's a tiny static site, generated by
[Salt](http://github.com/waferbaby/salt/), my equally little site generator.

Interested in cloning the site for your own interviews, similar or otherwise?
HELL YEAH! These are the questions I email people:

	1) Who are you, and what do you do? (Try to keep this brief!)
	2) What hardware do you use?
	3) And what software?
	4) What would be your dream setup?
